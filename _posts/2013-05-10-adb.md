[Adb](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html) (*Android Debug Bridge*) is a command-line tool that allows you to achieve some operations over a real or emulated device connected to your computer. You can find it in `<android-sdk>/platform-tools`.

If you haven't the **Android SDK**, visit the [official site](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html) to download it.

## Some useful examples

An interesting use of adb is to know how many devices are currently connected to your computer:

{% highlight bash %}
adb devices
{% endhighlight %}

The next one allows you to install an app:

{% highlight bash %}
adb install <path to .apk file>
{% endhighlight %}

You could reinstall it withouth deleting previous user data:

{% highlight bash %}
adb install -r <path to .apk file>
{% endhighlight %}

Or install it on SD storage:

{% highlight bash %}
adb install -s <path to .apk file>
{% endhighlight %}
&nbsp;

## Device shell

With `adb shell` you can access to the `device management console` and once you're into it, for example, you could change the device/emulator language:

{% highlight bash %}
setprop persist.sys.language en;
setprop persist.sys.country GB;
stop;
sleep 5;
start;
exit
{% endhighlight %}

The next option will be very useful if you're running out of device internal storage, since it forces the installation of any app on the SD:

{% highlight bash %}
adb shell pm setInstallLocation 2
{% endhighlight %}

Available alternatives are:

* `0` - Automatic location (default)
* `1` - Internal storage
* `2` - SD storage
